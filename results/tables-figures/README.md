# Scripts to create tables and figures:

### Scripts that read in versioned results:

- `table-1.R`: Main simulation results for the paper. Reads in versioned results.
- `table-2.R`: Sensitivity analysis for the estimation of FRR. Reads in versioned results.
- `figure-A4.R`: Sample size comparison figure. Reads in versioned results.

### Explanatory figures:

- `figure-1.R`: Plot of phi functions used for assays 1A-D and 2A-D.
- `figure-A1.R`: Incidence functions and distribution of infection times.
- `figure-A2-3.R`: Data generating process based on Duong et al. 2015 data.i

### Data analysis:
- `data-analysis.R`: Uses external data to illustrate estimators.
