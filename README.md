# Cross-Sectional Recency Assay Incidence Estimation

## Description
This repository contains:
- An installable package to calculate cross-sectional incidence estimates from recency assays, and to generate past infection times.
- Code to reproduce the results in the paper here [ADD PAPER CITATION HERE] on statistical issues in estimating counterfactual HIV incidence with recency assays.
- Source code for a Shiny application that runs simulations similar to the paper.

## Installation

To download the package, simulation, and application code, you may clone the repository:
```{r}
git clone https://github.com/mbannick/XSReceny.git
```
