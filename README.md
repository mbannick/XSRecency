# Cross-Sectional Recency Assay Incidence Estimation

## Description
This repository contains:
- `.`: An installable package to calculate cross-sectional incidence estimates from recency assays, and to generate past infection times.
- `results`: Code to reproduce the results in the paper here [ADD PAPER CITATION HERE] on statistical issues in estimating counter-factual HIV incidence with recency assays.

## Installation

You can install the package with `devtools`:
```{bash}
devtools::install_github("mbannick/XSRecency")
```

Or to download the package, simulation, and application code, you may clone the repository:
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/mbannick/XSReceny.git
